# deeplearning-stock-mkt-prediction

In this project we aim to predict the change in movement of the mid-range prices for Wayfair Inc. (NYSE: W) using the limit
order book data from NASDAQ. As part of our process, we implement deep learning models, such as Feed Forward Neural
Network (FFNN), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). We test these models with
different parameters and architectures and conclude that best accuracy is given by the FFNN model with two hidden layers,
Gradient Descent Optimizer and a ReLU activation function. We compare the models built on neural networks to our
baseline models built using kNN and SVM and find that the FFNN model scores higher on accuracy compared to the baseline
models.
